Based on the comments in the code, here are some suggestions:

In the 
PDFEmbedder
 class, the get_openai_embedding method checks if the input text is a list. However, there is no check for an empty list. An empty list might cause an error or unexpected behavior. A check should be added to handle this case.
In the 
PDFProcessor
 class, the process_file method extracts text from a file, saves it, splits it into chunks, and then generates embeddings for each chunk. However, there is no error handling in case the file cannot be opened, the text cannot be extracted, or the embeddings cannot be generated. Error handling should be added to make the code more robust.
In the 
DatabaseManager
 class, the insert_vectors method inserts vectors into a database table. However, there is no check to ensure that the table exists or that the vectors are in the correct format. Checks should be added to handle these cases.
In the 
QueryProcessor
 class, the sanitize_query method removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the query and converts it to lowercase. However, this might not be desirable in all cases, as some queries might require special characters or case sensitivity. The method should be modified to handle these cases.
In the 
UserInteraction
 class, the interact method gets a user query, sanitizes it, generates and stores embeddings, and then generates a response. However, there is no error handling in case the user input is invalid, the embeddings cannot be generated, or the response cannot be generated. Error handling should be added to make the code more robust.
In the 
FinalAnalysis
 class, the text_completion method generates a text completion using the OpenAI API. However, there is no error handling in case the API request fails. Error handling should be added to make the code more robust.
The code uses both the OpenAI and Cohere APIs to generate embeddings. However, it might be more efficient to use only one API if possible. This would reduce the number of API calls and potentially improve performance.
The code uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize the embedding process. However, the number of threads is not specified, which means that the default number of threads is used. It might be more efficient to specify a number of threads that is optimal for the specific hardware and workload.
