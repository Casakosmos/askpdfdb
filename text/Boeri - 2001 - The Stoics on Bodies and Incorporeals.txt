It WAS A WIDESPREAD view IN LATE ANTIQUITY that the Stoics main

tained theses contrary to common conceptions?absurd, incompre
hensible, or simply false. In other words, the Stoics were generally ac
cused of having been guilty of incongruity, self-contradiction, and
absurdity.1 Indeed some specific Stoic claims2 must have been partic
ularly baffling for authors coming from the Platonic and Aristotelian
tradition, mostly because these sorts of tenets were in disagreement
with some basic assumptions of such a tradition. Alexander of Aphro
disias, for example, correctly suggests that the tensional movement,

the Stoic thesis of supreme genus "incomprehensible and absurd" ( aovvexov

attributed by the Stoics to Jtve?3?ia, does not fall into the Aristotelian

classification of xlvti?lc.3 No doubt Alexander is right in noting this

point because, according to Aristotle's view, jrvei3?ia's movement
would be neither substantial (generation/destruction), quantitative
(increase/diminution), qualitative (alteration), nor locative (locomo
tion). Nonetheless Alexander's attempt to reject the Stoic thesis of
tensional movement on this ground is misleading. The fact that the
tensional movement is not included in Aristotle's scheme does not
show that such a type of movement does not exist or that it is not pos

sible to explain phenomena making use of an explanatory mechanism
in which the tensional movement is crucial. It only indicates the im
possibility of trying to grasp Jtveu^ia and its properties with criteria
which turn out to be useless for the assessment of such an entity that

is for the most part described in our sources as moving "simulta
neously inwards and outwards" (xovixf|v Tiva eivai x?vr|Gtv jtbqL x?
o(b[iaxa 8l? to e?oco ?|ia xai ei? to e^oo xivou?i?vriv).4

I have cited and briefly commented on Alexander's remark

against the Stoics because I think that this type of criticism is repre
sentative of what we can find in the testimonies for early Stoicism,
particularly in those sources hostile to the Stoics, such as Plotinus, Pl
utarch, Galen, and of course Alexander himself. Plotinus, for exam

ple, seems to be attacking the Stoic doctrine of principles when he
says that if something is active and involves in some sense the charac
teristics of a form (or of an energeia), this something cannot be bodily
or material. In other words, Plotinus cannot accept the Stoic thesis of
the material principles5 for, as he puts it,

3 Alexander seems to suggest this when saying "xai nax? xi ei?o?

god for them [namely for the Stoics] is posterior to matter as well, for it
is <conceived of as> a body composed of matter and form. And where
did it get its form from? But if he does not have matter, because of hav

ing the nature of a principle, that is to say, because of being reason
(aQxoeibri? oov xai X?yoc), then god would have to be incorporeal, and
the active would have to be incorporeal (?oobjiaTo? ?v e?r\ o 6e?c, xai t?

body?6

In fact, for Plotinus to tl^ilov, that which involves greater value,7
does not pertain to the sphere of the corporeal, since this is directly

related to the material things that, as material, imply passivity and
lack of form. Plutarch is in the same line of thought when arguing that
if the Stoic god is neither something pure nor something simple but

something composed, he must be dependent on something else (for
the Stoics, matter, in being simple, involves the features of a princi
ple).8 By contrast, the Stoics held that only corporeal things have a

sumed to be bodies. For evidence see Diogenes Laertius 7.134-5 (SVF 1:85,
2:299, 2:300; LS, 44B, 45E, 50E). In Diogenes Laertius 7.134.17 (H. S. Long's
text, Diogenis Laertii Vitae Philosophorvm [Oxonii: Scriptorum Classi

von Arnim (SVF 2:299) and H. S. Long read aocojiorcouc following the Suda

lexicon. This reading puts forward philological as well as philosophical prob
lems. As noted by Jaap Mansfeld, "Zeno of Citium: Critical Observations on a
Recent Study," Mnemosyne 31, no. 2 (1978): 162-3 and 169, it is likely that
?ocDiicrcou? is an anticipation of ?[iOQ(j)ou?;, which is said of the principles as
well, von Arnim's reading (followed by Robert B. Todd, "Monism and Imma

nence: The Foundations of Stoic Physics," in The Stoics, ed. John M. Rist
[Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978], 139-43)
goes against a number of testimonies maintaining that, according to the Sto
ics, a real cause is what is bodily. Indeed, god is a cause. The new edition of

the Diogenes Laertius text by Miroslav Marcovich, Diogenis Laertii Vitae

Philosophorvm (Stuttgart and Leipzig: Teubner, 1999) gives o(b\iaxa follow

real causal power with respect to other things. It seems to me that
this thesis contains an implicit and serious attack on the Platonic and
Aristotelian view according to which forms and ends are not only the
real causal factors but also the items that especially deserve to be
called causes, at least if they are compared to the material things
whose causal agency is primarily restricted to the domain of neces
sary conditions.9
Among the ancient authors there was a wide acceptance that the
Stoics were the champions of the idea that the corporeal is the essen
tial hallmark of the existent.10 According to the Stoic orthodoxy,
something is actually real if it is corporeal. Thus, the Stoic philoso
phers did leave aside the Platonic and Aristotelian ontology which
gave the intelligible the highest place in the hierarchy of beings, and
they did so by maintaining that only what is corporeal is capable of
acting or of being acted upon.11 The Stoics are also said to have devel
oped a complex theory of incorporeals (?o(b\iaxa), "somethings"
which, albeit nonexistent in a strict sense, are subsistent.12 But if the

must not come from another thing (Physics 1.5.188a26-30). He considers
that form (eldos) as a principle is the terminus ad quern of generation (see
1.9.192al6-30 and especially 193a30-bl2, where Aristotle tries to show that
in the matter/form relationship, form is prior to and determinant of matter.
Form, in fact, determines matter in virtue of its active character). On the is

THE STOICS ON BODIES AND INCORPOREALS

727

things truly existent are bodies, what role do incorporeals play in
Stoic ontology? Why did the Stoic philosophers consider it necessary
to put forward a strict distinction between the corporeal and the in

corporeal in their world's explanation, an explanation so strongly
dominated by the thesis that only the bodily beings are real? These
are some of the questions this paper intends to answer.
In the first part, I shall begin by making reference to some An
cient interpretations of the Stoic doctrine of incorporeals. At this
point I hope to show that some views on Stoicism held by authors like
Proclus, Plutarch, or Alexander are misleading, mostly because either
they take incorporeals to be secondary realities (bodies being the pri
mary ones) or because they raise their objections to Stoic claims start
ing from quite a different conceptual scheme. Although the view that

incorporeals are inferior realities would seem to be plausible (and in
fact this view has been accepted by conspicuous contemporary schol
ars), I shall endeavor to demonstrate that this sort of interpretation is
not consistent with Stoic philosophy as a whole and that, accordingly,

11 As David Hahm points out, the characterization of body as what is ca

pable of acting or of being acted upon does not appear in our sources as a
theoretical definition but it is always presupposed in a number of arguments

as a distinctive aspect of what is a body. See his The Origins of Stoic Cos
mology (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1977), 3. See also Cicero,

incorporeals can plausibly be thought to be of such a kind that they
turn out to be essential in accounting for bodily things as well. Sec
ond, and following this line of thought, it will be suggested that bodies

and incorporeals are complementary terms. At this point my argu
ment will be that bodies and incorporeals serve to complement each
other in the sense that one cannot exist without the other. Thus, be

tween 0(b\iaxa and a?co^iaTa there seems to be a reciprocal depen
dence. Finally, in the last part some key passages of Stoic physics and
ethics (in which the mentioned dependence can be corroborated) will
be examined and I shall provide arguments to clarify the corporeal/in
corporeal issue in Stoic philosophy.

II
The four species of incorporeals (A,exT?v, xev?v, t?jtoc, xq?voc)
are listed by Sextus Empiricus.13 As already indicated, due to their
"physicalism,"14 the Stoics made corporeality the essential clue of the
existent, of the real. Yet if the existent in the strict sense consists of
bodies, one can legitimately raise doubts about the role (if any) incor
poreals play in the Stoic account of reality. Some ancient authors
have assumed that incorporeals must have a dependent way of being,
and for this reason they were thought to be "subsistent." This was

Proclus's view. He maintained that the Stoics made time a mere
thought, insubstantial and very close to the nonexistent. This is so,

Proclus goes on to argue, because time is one of the incorporeals,
which are despised by Stoics as being inactive, nonexistent, and
merely subsistent in mind (?v ?mvoiai? ?(j)ioT?[i?va ipi?m?).15
In spite of what Proclus says, I do not think that the Stoics re

garded incorporeals as secondary or dependent "somethings."16
13 Sextus Empiricus, Adversus Mathematicos 10.218.
141 am taking this terminology from Julia Annas, Hellenistic Philosophy
of Mind (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1992), 37

8.

15 See Proclus, On Plato's Timaeus 271D. I agree with LS 2:304, that

"nothing in reported statements of Stoic philosophers justifies Proclus's re
duction of time to a mere thought." According to Long and Sedley, Proclus
may have been influenced by some doxographical formulations as Sextus,

Adversus Mathematicos 10.277: "aoob^iaTov tl xa65 a?T? voo?jievov
i)jt?OTT|oavTO Tov xq?vov." A very similar formulation occurs at Adversus

Mathematicos 10.218 (SVF 2:331; LS, 27D).

THE STOICS ON BODIES AND INCORPOREALS

729

Neither do they seem to have assumed that incorporeals should be de

spised because of being inactive and nonexistent. The difficulty
raised by Stoic philosophers is that, even though place, time, void, and
sayables17 are incorporeal, they turn out to be fundamental to consti
tute the realm of the existent. The case of time is especially sugges
tive: despite being an incorporeal, time is a necessary condition for
the constitution of objective reality (by "objective reality" I mean the
realm of the corporeal things, the set of objects that constitute our
"objective experience"). There is a passage in Clement of Alexandria,
in a context that is supposed to be Stoic in character, where time is
shown to be a cause in the sense of a necessary condition.18 In this
text Clement says that time is that which offers the notion of the con
ditions without which the effect cannot be produced (? ?? XQOvo? tc?v

(bv oux aveu ^?yov eji?/ei).19 This is specially applied to the case of
learning: the father is a preliminary cause (jiQoxaTaQXTix?v a?xiov) of
learning, the teacher the synectic cause (?uvexTix?v a?/ciov), the natu
ral disposition to learning is the auxiliary cause (ouvepyov a?/ciov),
16 Nonetheless, this is what Andreas Graeser seems to think when point
ing out that "in Stoic usage the Greek language equivalent to our 'subsist'
clearly signifies what may be called a subordinate or rather dependent mode
of existence, one that is distinct from being real in the sense of being tangible

and thus capable of acting and being acted upon." See Graeser, "The Stoic

Theory of Meaning," in The Stoics, ed. John M. Rist (Berkeley and Los Ange
les: University of California Press, 1978), 89. Long ("Language and Thought
in Stoicism," 90) seems to imply the same thing in saying that " hyphestanai
hyphistasthai expresses a state subordinate to that denoted by hyparchein
or einai." It is true, as Graeser observes, that an incorporeal like a lekton is
not real in the sense of being tangible. As I hope to show, however, it does
not follow from this that "the lekta are not something in the world"; Long,
"Language and Thought in Stoicism," 89. In analyzing the Stoic theory of cat
egories or genera of being, Graeser appears to imply the same thing. See An
dreas Graeser, Zenon von Kition. Positionen und Probleme (Berlin and New
York: Walter De Gruyter, 1975), 18^23.
171 follow LS (section 33) in rendering lekta as "sayables." For recent
discussion on the difficulties involved in translating the term lekton and its
philosophical implications in Stoic philosophy, see Frede, "The Stoic Notion
of a lekton," especially 110-19.
18 Clement, Stromateis 8.9.25, from Clemens Alexandrinus. Stromata.
VII und VIII, ed. Otto St?hlin and Ludwig Fr?chtel (Berlin: Akademie Verlag,
1970), ( SVF 2:346). Indeed it would be inconsistent to speak of time as a spe
cies of causality because, as suggested above, if a factor is a cause of another
one, such a factor must be corporeal. Actually, evidence that time is a cause
is scanty and Clement's example is, as far as I know, the only source which
takes time to be a kind of causality.
19 Clement, Stromateis 8.89, 24, 4.

and time, finally, is the necessary condition of the learning process.
Here it is suggested that learning, because it is a process, is supposed
to imply a certain duration. In other words, if learning is understood
as a process, it requires a before and an after: a before in which the in
dividual has not yet learned and an after in which the individual has
already learned. If one seeks to establish a coherent account of this
phenomenon, one has to take into account time, because learning in

volves a process that is only understandable in time which, despite
being incorporeal, measures motions or shifts of corporeal things in
orderly sequences.20 However, this does not resolve the aforemen
tioned inconsistency, according to which time cannot be considered a

cause in the strict sense because of being incorporeal. It could be
suggested, though, that Clement is making reference to a very general
use of the word "cause," one of the Stoic uses of the term.21 Following
Clement's line of thought, according to which "if something is a 'be
cause of which' (?i'o?) it is not in all cases also a cause" ("in the strict
sense," I would add),22 one could think of time as being a cause just in
the sense of a "because of which." As a result of the fact that time is

an indispensable requirement for the explanation of any phenomenon
in the material world, it is a "because of which" cause inasmuch as it
gives assistance to the constitution of the existent, that which, in the
strict sense, is a cause.
Therefore, despite the fact that time is incorporeal, it is, like the
other incorporeals, a necessary condition for the existence of bodies.
All existent things must exist in a place; but in addition to this it is im
possible to establish causal relations among things if there is no time,
that is to say if there is no factor capable of setting the before and the
after of the possible combinations among the existent things, so that
it can be possible to determine, for example, that A in tx is a cause of B

20 Chrysippus is said to have posited the basic distinction between time
as the dimension of motion, according to which the measure of speed and
slowness is spoken of, and time as the dimension "accompanying the world's
motion"; Stobaeus, Excerpts 1.106, 5-9; see SVF 2:509; LS 1:304.
21 See Frede, "The Origina

1 Notion of Cause," 220-1 and Stobaeus, Excerpts 1.138, 14-23, who

clearly attributes this wide sense of cause both to Zeno and Chrysippus. As
Ioppolo puts it, "to say that the cause is 'that because of which' means to
know what the thing is in its generality but without capturing its essential
feature"; "II concetto di causa," 4526.

in t2. Although time does not seem to fit into the more orthodox char
acterization of cause (for it is not a body), it is the factor which allows
us to establish a relation of causality, a relation for which the temporal

component is essential for distinguishing what the cause and the ef
fect are. Time, as incorporeal, appears to have an intermediate posi
tion between that which is absolutely (body) and that which is nothing
(time being a something for it is different from nothing). Regardless

of time being incorporeal, we should not conclude, as Proclus does,
that time is something purely mental and only subsistent in the mind.23

The Stoics also introduced the notion of "being present" or "being
there" (ujtaQX?LV): time, insofar as it is an incorporeal something, is
subsistent; but according to a subtler distinction, the past and the fu
ture only subsist (vfyeoxavai), while the present is there, that is, exists
in some way.24 I suggest, then, that, in Stoic terms, there is no existent
which, in order to be what it is, can exist without time.

The same thing can be said about void and sayables: singular ob
jects (the existents) cannot exist unless they are in the domain of spe
cifically defined spatial-temporal relationships. There is a passage in
Sextus Empiricus that might confirm, at least partially, my hypothesis
that there must be a relationship of complementarity between bodies

23 The expression "nonexistent" should be understood in two senses: (a)
in the technical Stoic sense that something (as time or void) does not exist
but subsist, and (b) in the common sense that something does not exist in
any way. The confusion between (a) and (b) is probably the one that Proclus

has in mind when attacking the Stoic position. I am indebted to Ricardo

Salles for urging me to clarify this point.

24 See Stobaeus, Excerpts 1.106, 5-23 (SVF 2:509; LS, 51B). However, ac

cording to Chrysippus, no time is wholly present (enistatai). There is no

present in the strict sense, although broadly it can be called such. The ex
pression "to be present," "to be there" (hyparchein) can be properly applied
to the present; by contrast, the past and the future merely subsist (hyphe

stanai). For a very clear and persuasive discussion of this passage, see
Frede, "The Stoic Notion of a lekton," 117-18, whose translation of hy

parchein as "being present," "being there" I am following. It would be conve
nient, it seems to me, to avoid rendering hyparchein as "to be real" (as David

Sedley does in The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy, ed. Ke

impe Algra, Jonathan Barnes, Jaap Mansfeld, and Malcolm Schofield [Cam
bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999], 398). According to Sedley, the

point of Chrysippus's remark with regard to the present is "to make it a spe
cial kind of incorporeal." That is probably true but the present is already an
incorporeal and, as such, it is not "real," at least in the sense of something
fully existent. Whatever the case may be, the language in the case of the in
corporeal time is very misleading and extremely hard to render.

and incorporeals. In effect, he quotes25 the Stoic distinction between

?^ov and jt?v, and notes that, in accordance with the Stoics, the
world is a whole (o?,ov) whereas the external surrounding void to
gether with the world is an all (jt?v). Clearly what is involved here is
that the void (one of the incorporeals) does not subsist without the
world, which is of course a body. Yet the world does not exist with
out void. Therefore, neither the world nor the void can be what they

are except in close connection. Sayables (^exT?i) also play a crucial
role in the constitution of the real and corporeal world, for one of
their basic functions consists in establishing the logical-linguistic rela
tions which permit us to categorize the object, so that we can know it.
To be sure, for the Stoics there is a crucial difference between saying
(?iyeiv) something and uttering (jCQO^?peoBat) it: sounds are uttered
(or "pronounced") but things or the states of affairs (x? 7iQ?y\iaxa),
which indeed are sayables, are said (X?yeTai).26 It is obvious from this
passage not only that for the Stoics sounds are uttered and meaning
ful things (or simply "meanings") are said (because they are lekta) but
also that if a corporeal thing X is something to a human, it must be
meaningful, and X is significant if and only if it is analyzed through the
logos.27 So sayables are clearly important in the constitution of the
material world for a human being. A sayable, as the significant inten
tion of the discourse (whether this is a true or false proposition, or a
complex argument), plays a relevant role in the Stoic psychology of
action, too. According to the evidence, the structure of the Stoic psy
chology of action is described as having the following steps: the first
one is the presentation (fyavxaoia), which in the case of the human
being is expressed through articulated language. The presentation is

followed by an assent (ouyxaTa08oL?) which is the act of accepting
such a presentation as true.28 Finally, when one gives assent to the
proposition expressing the content of a presentation, the assent be
comes an impulse (?Q|if|) for action. This accounts for the fact that,
as Stobaeus reports, "all the impulses are assents."29 The relevance of
sayables can be seen more clearly when looking into the Stoic thesis

25 Sextus Empiricus, Adversus Mathematicos 9.332.
26 Diogenes Laertius 7.57 (LS, 33A; compare SVF 2:149 ).
27 For a clear discussion of the Stoic distinction between "saying" and
"uttering" see Catherine Atherton, The Stoics on Ambiguity (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1993), 283-4.

that there is no rational action in the strict sense unless there is an in

termediate process of "rational evaluation" between presentation and
action itself. The capacity of expressing in words the contents of pre
sentations is a typically human feature for, as Diogenes Laertius says

in reporting Stoic doctrine,30 the human thought is capable of

28 The sequence presentation-assent-impulse is reported by Cicero, Aca
d?mica 2.24-5; this testimony is confirmed by Plutarch, On Stoic self-contra
dictions 1057A (SVF 3:177; LS, 53S) and partially by Diogenes Laertius 7.49 .

Seneca, for his part, offers the sequence presentation-impulse-assent (Let
ters, 113, 18) but his evidence is isolated and does not fit into the orthodox
explanation. However, when explaining how anger is produced Seneca ap
pears to go back to the supposedly orthodox account. In fact, he says that
anger (ira) is set in motion by a presentation (species) received of a wrongful
act (iniuria), and suggests that anger does not follow immediately without
the involvement of mind giving assent to the presentation (On anger 2.1.3).
Seneca is probably rendering the Greek synkatathesis ("assent") with the ex

pressions uaccedents animus" or ''animus adprobans" and uphantasia" with
species. For a detailed discussion of the topic see Janine Fillion-Lahille, Le

expressing (?ioivoia ?xXa^r]TLxr|), and communicates with language
that which it experiences due to the agency of presentation.31
In all these cases the core function of a sayable seems to be both
to articulate and to give meaning to the reality through the discourses
in which existents are expressed or accounted for. In other words, in

corporeals cannot be despised (pace Proclus) since they are neces
sary conditions for understanding the existents. To be sure, it is
through language, which involves a connection between thinking and
reality, that we articulate reality in such a way that it is significant to

us. The fact is that the (incorporeal) meaning of something can be
only conveyed by words (which are corporeal); indeed, words are in
dispensable for the expression of a sayable (namely a proposition or
an argument). Thus words and meanings never appear separately.
Sayables, despite being incorporeals, are somethings that enable us to
establish the connections between ourselves and the universe, utiliz
ing the logos through which we articulate reality.32 Incorporeals, then,
are not placed on a level lower than bodies because we cannot fail to
include incorporeals as part of what constitutes and accounts for the
objective reality, that is, the corporeal reality. The Stoic standpoint
seems to be that although incorporeals are inexistent (and therefore
they are "unreal"), they are yet indispensable conditions that make up
the reality of the corporeal. In this sense incorporeals occupy an in
termediate position in Stoic ontology: because they lack body, which
gives an objective reality to beings, they are incorporeal. However, at

31 At this point I am assuming (without argument) the orthodox position
according to which the Stoics distinguished the psychological states of non
rational animals from those of rational animals. Salient holders of this thesis
are Michael Frede, "Stoics and Skeptics on Clear and Distinct Impressions,"

in Frede, Essays in Ancient Philosophy, 151-76 (especially 152-70); In
wood, Ethics and Human Action in Early Stoicism, 73-5, and LS 1:239-41.

For the other interpretation (that is, that the Stoics are not taken to hold that
perceptions of animals are completely devoid of propositional contents) see

Richard Sorabji, "Perceptual Content in the Stoics," Phronesis 35 (1990):
307-14, and more recently, Animal Minds and Human Morals: The Origins

of the Western Debate (London: Duckworth, 1993), 20-8.

pressions," 157-70, and more recently, "Stoic Epistemology," in The Cam

the same time they have the status of "somethings" because they are
different from absolute nothing.
It has been suggested in recent years that "it is apparent that in

the Stoic philosophy the term Incorporeal' is a cause of embarrass
ment and that further analysis of the question of time might increase
their perplexity."33 The same suggestion is repeated later when Tza
malikos says that "for Origen incorporeality and reality are not incom
patible ontological realities, as they virtually are for the Stoics."34 As
far as I can see, this scholar gives no arguments to prove the alleged

Stoic embarrassment with regard to incorporeals and, as far as I
know, there is no evidence that the Stoics have regarded their incor

poreals as embarrassing to their ontological scheme. Tzamalikos's
opinion may be understood once one realizes that this scholar be
lieves that for the Stoics incorporeality and reality are incompatible

ontological statuses.35 If Tzamalikos's assumption concerning the
term incorporeal is correct (quod non), the role of incorporeals in
physics and ethics would become inexplicable. However, from the
distinction between a?/riov and ahta and between the adjectives
in -Tov and -Teov (in both the spheres of physics and ethics respec
tively) it becomes plain that incorporeals not only play a relevant role
but also they are not incompatible ontological realities, that is to say,
their status as incorporeal is not at odds with the "real" things. I have
briefly quoted this interpretation of Stoic incorporeals because this
type of explanation is paradigmatic of what I take to be misleading
when trying to account for the relation between ?v and ?ir) ?v within
the sphere of Stoic ontology. Tzamalikos's view on Stoic incorporeals
is very similar to that of Proclus and, as I have said above, I cannot
find evidence for this sort of interpretation.
There is another piece of evidence (in the domain of Stoic dialec
tic) which should be briefly commented on for it might be useful to
throw light on the issue. In a well known passage Sextus suggests that
the Stoics seem to have made an interesting connection between the

discussion of the problem of truth and ethics.36 Sextus says that,

of the History of Ideas 52, no. 4 (1991): 540.

gen and the Stoic View of Time," 554).

according to the Dogmatists (that is to say, those who systematically
maintain positive theses on different topics),37 the true (akr\Q??;) is dif
ferent from the truth (??T|6?ia) in three ways: in substance (ouoia), in

constitution (ovox?oei), and in function (ouv??iei). The Stoics con
sidered that the true in substance is an incorporeal (ovoia ?lev, eitei t?
?lev cd?iG?? ?o(b[iaxov ?oTiv) because it is a predicate taking part in a

discourse (it is a sayable). The true, understood in terms of a prop
erty of the proposition, turns out to be an "incorporeal quality" per
taining to the genus of lekta, but the truth is a body (namely, some
thing corporeal) since it is knowledge declaratory of all true things,38
and knowledge is conceived of as the commanding part of the soul in

a certain condition, the commanding part being a body (for it is
breath, pne?ma, in a certain state). In constitution the true differs
from the truth since the true is something simple (like "I am talking"),
and the truth consists of the knowledge of many true things. Finally,
in function the true differs from the truth since the latter always exists

within the sphere of knowledge and, therefore, it just belongs to the

virtuous person. The true can also exist in the base person, since
such a person can say something true but the truth is related to the
mental disposition proper of the wise person and such a mental dispo

sition (that is, knowledge understood in terms of the commanding
part of the soul disposed in a certain way) is a body. In this case it is
also clear enough that for the Stoics the true/truth distinction involves

a concern which is not only epistemological but also ethical. The
mentioned distinction implies crucial connotations in the field of eth
ics and it is helpful to understand the rigid Stoic differentiation be
tween the wise and the base person: to account for the epistemic state

proper to the wise person ("knowledge"; episteme) and that to the
base or "inferior" person ("opinion"; doxa) one has, once more, to pre
suppose incorporeals as well as corporeal somethings.39
As indicated above, in order to speak of a body or of a series of
bodies related by order of occurrence, we must always posit certain

temporal, locative, and linguistic determinations and, in general
terms, a number of factors connected with what the Stoics used to
37 In this passage the Dogmatists Sextus is referring to are the Stoics.

call "the incorporeal." On this ground it is possible to argue that be
tween bodies and incorporeals there is a relation of reciprocal depen
dence. This proposal, it seems to me, helps to clarify at least two
points: first, the reason why the Stoics think it is necessary to include
incorporeal things in a strongly corporealistic ontology. Second, this
interpretation may help us to understand why the Stoics did not talk

about incorporeals as "ways of not being in an absolute sense," as Plu
tarch misleadingly suggests. In fact, in Plutarch's opinion, "it is absurd
and at odds with the common conception to say that something is but

is non-existent"?*

It is obvious here that Plutarch is putting emphasis on the Pla
tonic doctrine of \ir\ ?v in the sense of "an absolute non-being."41 But
this way of interpreting the issue, I contend, would not have been ac

cepted by the Stoics. The absolute not being (like evvor|?iaTa, for in

stance) would be a nothing, not an incorporeal.42 Concepts

(?vvor|(iaTa) and ideas (i??ai) are figments ((j)avT?o^iaTa) of the soul
that neither subsist (a distinctive feature of the incorporeal) nor are
somethings.43 Despite Plutarch's view, and as far as I can see, there is
no evidence to suggest that the early Stoics have maintained that in
corporeals are "not beings," that is to say ways of not being in an abso
lute manner. What seems to be suggested in Stoic sources is that in
corporeals "are not" or they "are nonexistent" in the sense that they
are not bodies. However, the fact of not being a body does not imply
not being absolutely.
40 See On common conceptions 1073D (Harold Cherniss's translation,
Plutarch's Moralia). Indeed Plutarch's remark is in agreement with the con
fusion (noted above, note 23) on the two senses of "nonexistent."
41 See Plato, Sophist 258d-259b.
42 See Alexander (reporting Stoic doctrine), On Aristotle's Topics 359,
14-16 (SVF2:329; LS, 30D: " ei ye to ^l?v ev xai xaTa toD ?wor|^aTo?- to ?? t?

xar? (i?vcov ooo^i?tcov xai ?acDji?TO?v xb ?? evv?rjjua jurj??regov rovr v
nax? xov? Ta?Ta X?yovTa?)."
43 Actually, the Stoics are assumed to have said that concepts are "quasi

somethings" (oboavei Tiva; Stobaeus, Excerpts 1.136, 2-23 ( SVF 1:65). See

also Simplicius, On Aristotle's Categories 105, 8-21 (compare SVF 2:278) and
Frede, "Principles of Stoic Grammar," in The Stoics, ed. John M. Rist (Berke
ley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1978), 32. Certainly the
issue of concepts in Stoic philosophy is highly controversial. For a compre

hensive discussion of the topic see Brunschwig, Papers in Hellenistic Phi

losophy, 99-104, and Victor Caston, "Something and Nothing: The Stoics on
Concepts and Universals," Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 17 (1999):

MARCELO D. BOERI

III
This section will concentrate on some specific Stoic texts that
show the way incorporeals work in the different parts of philosophi
cal discourse. Thus I shall be examining some key passages in which

bodies and incorporeals display the character of complementary
terms. First, my discussion will focus on Stoic physics. I shall begin
by considering the presumably44 Stoic distinction between a?/riov
("cause" or "cause in the strict sense") and ama ("causal account")
and offer an interpretation that makes consistent that distinction with
a theory of causality, according to which the bodies alone are capable

of bringing about something or other on another bodily thing.45 Sec
ond, I intend to explore the meaning of two important distinctions in
the domain of Stoic ethics: "being happy" (an incorporeal) and "happi

ness" (a body), on the one hand, and the adjectives with the verbal
suffix -tov and those with the verbal suffix -Teov, on the other hand.

The issue has been debated at length and scholars do not agree on the
true meaning of these distinctions.46 The main passages on this point
are collected in the summary of Stoic ethics by Stobaeus, who is gen
erally thought to be quoting Arius Didymus' ethical doctrines.47 In this
context we will also refer to the topic of impulse and assent and will

see how incorporeals work in the Stoic account of impulse, the im
pulse being that which goes intentionally toward what each one takes
to be good. Following the intended line of argument, for each of the

passages under consideration I shall endeavor to show the relevance
of the corporeal/incorporeal distinction in the explanation as a whole,
and offer some brief conclusions.

44 The sense of the adverb "presumably" is explained below in note 53.
45 In my judgment, by far the best discussion on the Stoic notion of cau

sality continues to be Frede's; see "The Original Notion of Cause." A good

abstract of the topic can be found in Jean J. Duhot, La conception sto?cienne

de la causalit? (Paris: Libraire Philosophique J. Brin, 1989), 87-100. See also
the penetrating and more philosophical remarks by Maximilian Forschner,

THE STOICS ON BODIES AND INCORPOREALS

739

The issue that is not under dispute in our sources is that, for the
Stoics, the truly existent things are bodies.48 Zeno maintained that the
principles of all things are the active and the passive, and in saying this
he implies that all that is existent is either active or passive. This also
47 The authorship of Stobaeus' extract of Stoic ethics has been widely
discussed; it was attributed to the first century Stoic philosopher Arius Didy
mus by August Meineke, "Zu Stobaeus," Sokrates: Zeitschrift f?r das Gym

nasialwesen, 13, ed. Julius M?tzell, Band 1 (Berlin, 1859), 563-65, and Her
man Diels, Doxographi Graeci (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1879), 69 and 78-88. One
of the first scholars in the last decades in questioning some assumptions of
the Meineke-Diels thesis was Michelangelo Giusta, / dossografi di etica, 2
vols. (Turin: G. Giappichelli Editore, 1964-7), 1:140-7, and "Ario Didimo e la
diairesis dell'etica di Eudoro di Alessandria," in Atti delta Accademia delle

scienze di Torino. Classe di scienze morali, storiche e filologiche 120

(1986): 102-3, although he keeps the hypothesis that one author was respon
sible for the three doxographies (I dossografi di etica 1:39). In recent times

the Meineke-Diels hypothesis was accepted (with some reservations) by

Charles Kahn, "Arius as a Doxographer," and Anthony A. Long, "Arius Didy

mus and the Exposition of Stoic Ethics," both papers included in On Stoic

and Peripatetic Ethics: The Work of Arius Didymus, ed. William W. Forten
baugh (New Brunswick and London: Transaction Books, 1983), 3-13 and 41
65, respectively. David E. Hahm, on his part, after a detailed examination of
the works by Meineke, Diels, Giusta, and other scholars has also concluded
that the author is the court philosopher Arius Didymus. See his "The Ethical
Doxography of Arius Didymus," in Aufstieg und Niedergang der r?mischen
Welt, ed. Wolfgang Haase (Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1990), es
pecially 3047-9. Tryggve G?ransson, however, has challenged the orthodox
interpretation and has argued vigorously against the identification of the au
thor in Stobaeus with the Alexandrian philosopher Arius Didymus. See Albi

nus, Alcinous, Arius Didymus (G?teborg: Acta Universitatis Gothoburgen
sis, 1995), 203-4, 209-10, 212-13, 216, 225-6, and 230-1. For a well-balanced
defense of the orthodox view see Brad Inwood, review of G?ransson, Bryn

Mawr Classical Review 7 (1996): 25-30. I have presented a brief review of
the status quaestionis concerning Arius Didymus in the introduction to my
Spanish translation of the extract of Stoic ethics included in Stobaeus; see
Victoria Julia, Marcelo D. Boeri, and Laura Corso, Las exposiciones antiguas

de ?tica estoica (Buenos Aires: Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires,

1998), 149-67. At any rate, whether the author of the extract is Arius Didy
mus or another person, what is beyond discussion is the fact that the content

of the second extract of ethical doxographies in Stobaeus 2.7 is genuinely
Stoic doctrine. The crucial passages in Stobaeus can be confirmed in Dio
genes Laertius 7.84-131 and Cicero, On Ends 3. This conclusion looks naive

and, in a certain sense, it is. Yet it also allows us to regard the doxography in

cluded in Stobaeus, Excerpts 2.7 as a serious Stoic piece of evidence which
informs us about details that are not developed in the other sources. Such

details are crucial for the reconstruction of the early Stoic ethics.

appears to be suggesting that anything which does not have these
characteristics must necessarily be nonexistent.49 The existent/non
existent difference can be clearly seen in the theory of causality,
where a strict terminological distinction of the words meaning
"cause" is noted. In Plato and Aristotle the Greek terms ama and
a?TLOv were used indistinctly.50 However, according to Stobaeus' tes
timony, Chrysippus asserted that aitia is the formula, an enunciation

or account (k?yoc) of a cause (a?/ciov).51 In other words, we are told
that an arr?a is a propositional item which is related to that which,
strictly speaking, is a cause: a body. An a?Tta is not a cause in the
strict sense because of being a propositional item; and if it is a propo
sitional item it will be an incorporeal. In fact, a proposition is an in
corporeal. However, according to the orthodox doctrine nothing in
corporeal can be a cause.
It is true that Stobaeus' passage is quite brief and gives no details
of what the aitia/aition distinction probably meant. Jaap Mansfeld
rejects the relevance of this distinction on the ground that in some
passages52 aitia is given as one of the names used by Chrysippus for
fate (8L|iaQ|i?vTi), others being a^f|6eia, cleric, and av?yxr].53 In a pas
sage where Galen is reporting doctrines supposedly Stoic,54 Mansfeld
goes on to argue, aitia and aition are used promiscuously and in a
passage of Plutarch's,55 an alleged (although not necessarily) verbatim
quotation of Chrysippus, the term aitia appears twice (and not mean
ing ?xSyo? Tfj? aiTia?). To sum up, according to Mansfeld, the words
aitia/aition are indistinctly used. At first glance Mansfeld's remarks
seem to be persuasive; but at any rate, the following should be noted.
First, Galen's text is a very hostile passage where he is trying to show
the absurdity of the Stoic thesis of synectic cause (ouvexTixov a?/tiov;
?uvexTLxri ama); if this is so, we cannot assume that what he is saying
is what the Stoics effectively intended to say. To be sure, in the Ga
lenic passage there is no difference between aitia and aition, and Ga

len uses both terms as meaning the same thing, but the fact that he
does not take the distinction for granted is not very significant be

cause he does not accept the sort of causation he is criticizing (the

synectic cause), either. Second, there is another place where Galen
tells us that there is clearly no difference between saying the word
"cause" either in feminine or in masculine gender.56 Actually, what
Galen implies is that he uses both terms interchangeably, not that the
Stoics use them in this way. Whatever the case may be, Galen gives no
clear reasons for proving the distinction is pointless. In Stobaeus' text
then, and pace Mansfeld, the distinction is explicitly made and the fact

that in other passages the words ama-amov are employed in the
53 See Mansfeld, "Zeno of Citium," 157. Frede ("The Original Notion of
Cause," 223) accepts the distinction as Stoic and holds that although the dif
ference between aition and aitia (that is to say, causes, on the one hand, and
reasons and accounts, on the other hand) was not generally accepted, the dis

tinction itself between causes and reasons or explanations was accepted.

Forschner, on his part, does find this distinction "interesting" and he thinks it

presumably is valid (Die stoische, 87). More recently, and following Mans
feld, Ioppolo has maintained that Chrysippus does not have a rigorous techni

cal use of both terms ("II concetto di causa," 4497-8). This suggestion, it
seems to me, is conjectural, and as far as I can see has no textual support. On
the other hand, we have a passage where the distinction is explicitly attrib

uted to Chrysippus (see Stobaeus, Excerpts 1.139, 3-4). Bobzein, on the

ground of Aetius 1.11.5 (SVF 2:340; LS, 55G), asserts that "the aitia of any in

dividual cause (aition) is the portion of rational pneuma which permeates

that cause," and so she also appears to dismiss the distinction between aitia
and aition. In fact, she notes that such a distinction seems lost in this pas

sage. See Susanne Bobzein, Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy

(New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 53 n. 96. In her translation of the
Stobaeus passage at issue (Excerpts 1.139, 3-4) she renders the word A,?yoc
as "reason" and in doing so, the distinction vanishes (see 53 n. 97). Certainly
"reason" is a possible rendering of logos; this translation is also adopted by
Roberto Radice in his recent Italian translation of the Stoic texts (compiled
by von Arnim in SVF), Stoici Antichi. Tutti I Frammenti (Milano: Rusconi,
1998), 513. In my view, in order for the Stobaeus passage to make sense,
logos is to be taken as meaning "formula," "enunciation." See LS, 55A (who

give "judgement") and Karlheinz H?lser, Die Fragmente zur Dialektik der
Stoiker. Neue Sammlung der Texte mit deutscher ?bersetzung und Kom

mentaren, Bans 2 (Stuttgart: Bad Cannstatt, 1987), 899, text 762 (who renders
"die Rede"). In what follows I try to offer an explanation for why the evi
dence, on which the interpretation that Chrysippus did not distinguish accu
rately between aitia and aition is based, is not absolutely reliable.

same way does not account for the distinction which Stobaeus explic
itly attributes to Chrysippus. It is not impossible that, depending on
the context, Chrysippus would have made wider use of the two terms.
Perhaps this distinction might be a peculiar technical usage which, al
though it could be acknowledged by authors like Plutarch and Galen
(cited by Mansfeld), should not be necessarily admitted. I would sug
gest that while making this distinction Chrysippus was thinking of
something like this: when you say "the sun warms the stone," you are
uttering the "causal account," the propositional item describing the
fact or event caused by the aition and, eventually, the truth of the
proposition describing such fact or event. Such a causal account does

describe the phenomenon of temperature's increasing which acts
upon the stone, and the increased temperature is produced as a result
of the sun's caloric energy, but the cause in the strict sense (ot?/riov) is

the sun (a body) acting upon the stone (another body).57 The cause
(the sun) and the caused object (the stone) are bodies; on its part the
effect ("being hot") is, as the orthodox Stoic doctrine on causality re

quires, an incorporeal. Thus the sun (a body) becomes the cause to
the stone (another body) of the incorporeal predicate "being hot."58
But if this is so (as it is), the effect is a predicate, an incorporeal. If
the effect is a predicate, the difficulty of how to analyze the causal
processes whose result is the production of new entities arises. Such
a difficulty probably led some Stoics to think that the effect is a predi

cate as well as an entire proposition such as "a ship is built." Such a
proposition becomes true as a result of the shipbuilder's activity.59
One could wonder why a distinction between cause (a body) and

causal account (an incorporeal) should be put forward in a strongly
57 The example of the sun is taken from Sextus, Pyrrhoneae Hypoty
poses 3.14, who probably has the Stoics in mind in writing: "the sun or the
heat of the sun is cause of the wax melting or of the melting of the wax";
translation by Julia Annas and Jonathan Barnes, Sextus Empiricus: Outlines
of Scepticism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994).
58 The other example, also collected by Sextus, is that of the scalpel: a
scalpel (which is a body) is a cause to the flesh (another body) of the incor

poreal predicate "being cut." See Sextus, Adversus Mathematicos 9.207-11
and Pyrrhoneae Hypotyposes, 3.14, with Jonathan Barnes's remarks in his
"Pyrrhonism, Belief and Causation," in Aufstieg und Niedergang der r?mis

corporealistic ontology like the Stoic one. I would offer for consider
ation the following conjecture: according to the basic Stoic ontologi
cal classification, the first and highest genus is "the something" (to t?),

in which bodies and incorporeals are included.60 If my approach?
that bodies and incorporeals are necessary components of reality and
that between them there is no one component more important than
the other?is correct, one might draw the conclusion that incorpore
als should somehow play a role even in the sphere of the doctrine of

causation. The causal account (ama), despite not being a cause in
the strict sense, is relevant for the whole causal account insofar as it is

the means through which a determined causal event can be expressed

by language, and thus through which the object can be grasped. On
the other hand, it should be noted that the cause/effect relationship is
closely related to the process of knowledge. For the human being the
first contact with the world is through the senses; they offer the mate
rial aspect of knowledge. Although the soul (or rather "the command
ing part of the soul"; t? f|y8^iovix?v) is like a sheet of paper ready for

writing upon,61 there are "ingrained or implanted preconceptions"
(jtQO^f|^8L? 8?ii(J)UTOi) as well,62 which are natural rational components
whose function is to determine and to help interpret the stuff provided
by the senses. According to Diogenes Laertius' report, for the Stoics a

preconception is a "natural conception of the universal things" (or
simply "universals"; evvoia cj)U?ixfi x(hv xaB?Axnj).63 The function of
preconceptions in the Stoic theory of knowledge seems to have been
searching for and finding out a new knowledge.64 Possessing the

general notion of the distinctive characteristics of an object allows us

to search for a more accurate knowledge of such an object. Human
reason is completed from our preconceptions during our first seven
years of life. With the full development of reason65 the ability to dis

criminate in conceptual terms and the relation among things is
stressed, and this relation can be expressed more accurately. The
cause/effect relationship is not left out of this process: if we want to
have a full understanding of the causal relationship, we are to make
the aition/aitia distinction, so that the true causal agent can be dis
tinguished from the causal formula that makes intelligible a particular
phenomenon by the agency of the articulated language. Moreover, as
indicated above, in the Stoic account of causality the effect is a predi
cate, a sayable. Thus predicates are closely involved in the causal ex
planation of a bodily entity; in this sense, we should accept that say
ables (one of the canonical incorporeals) are quite "real" and they do
not depend on the human mind for their subsistence.66 In sum, both

aspects, the logical/linguistic and the strictly causal one, are indis
pensable for accounting for anything which can be explained in terms
such as "A is the cause to B" or "between A and B there is a causal re

lationship."
As we have already said, in the sphere of Stoic ethics the corpo
real/incorporeal discrimination also appears, and in this domain it is
highly relevant as well. In this context the Stoic thesis that the truly
real is corporeal also played a distinctive role. In the Stoic sources we
find the following argument: if quality is "matter disposed in a certain
way" (as, according to the Stoics, it is)67 and if the substance of a thing

can be compared to the material constituent of an object (and the
qualities of things must be themselves corporeal), the different states
of the soul (namely virtues, passions, impulses, assents, and so forth)
are to be corporeal, too.68 Virtue is the soul (or, more accurately, its
commanding part) disposed in a certain way. Once the material char

acter of the soul has been shown, it follows that the affective states of

the soul must be so, too. In fact, the states pertaining to the realm of

emotions or feelings (such as shame and fear) become evident in
one's face.69 Since there is neither action nor change that can take
place without contact, states of the soul, as well as the body, have to
be capable of acting or of being acted upon. Soul, then, shares its af
fections with the body. This picture largely describes the Stoic corpo

realism, but even in Stoic ethics the corporeal/incorporeal relation
was significant.
According to Stobaeus' evidence, Chrysippus and his followers
held happiness (8i)oai?iov?a) to be a goal or a target (oxojto?), while
the end (T8?,o?) is attaining happiness (tu)(8lv euoai^ioviac), which ac
tually is the same as being happy (8?oai?iov8?v).70 Like Aristotle, the
Stoics used to hold that there was an end ("an ultimate object of de
sire") for the sake of which the other things should be done, that is,
being happy. As a matter of fact, according to the Stoics just being
happy is the end (telos), for they take happiness and being happy to be
two different things. Unlike Aristotle, who had used telos and skopos

interchangeably to make reference to the end,71 the Stoics distin
guished two kinds of finality.72 Attaining happiness is the end, the

theless accepts the Stoic distinction between goal and end. The goal of med

effective achievement of happiness, possessing happiness in the sense
of fully having it. Attaining happiness is the end in terms of our over
all telos, "that for the sake of which everything is done but which itself

is done for the sake of nothing," "the ultimate object of desire (to
eoxaTov T(bv ?Q8XT(ov), that to which everything else is referred."73

Each one is concerned not actually with happiness as a goal (skopos)
but with happiness in the sense of the effective achievement (telos).

We are happy just when we have effectively reached happiness. On
the other hand, happiness understood in terms of a goal (skopos) can

be regarded as an object external to the virtuous activity; it is the
body set forth or proposed which the human beings aim to attain, that
which I should pursue as an agent to be really happy.74 But the end as
the virtuous activity itself is the achievement of the intended goal; ac
tually it is the ultimate object of desire, to which all the others are re
ferred.75 According to the Stoics, then, we aim at being happy, not at
happiness, which is our immediate goal.76
As is obvious, the distinction underlying the difference between

goal and end is the ontological distinction between corporeal and in
corporeal. While a skopos (expressed by a noun: "happiness") is a
body, a telos (expressed by a verb or, in the Stoic jargon, by a predi
cate: "being happy") is an incorporeal. The expressions "living" (t,f\v)
and "being happy" (eu?ai^iove?v) used in Stoic definitions of end (te
los) were considered predicates. This can be verified by considering
some Stoic passages,77 and is confirmed by the Stoic thesis that the

(exxeloOca) as the goal (oxojto?) of rhetoric, whereas its end (T8?,o?) is the
attainment of persuasion" (t? ruxetv ttj? jt8i6oi5?). See Stobaeus, Excerpts
2.77, 25-7 (SVF 3:16; LS, 643A), where the same language is used in distin
guishing between happiness (the goal) and the attainment of happiness (the
end). Certainly this Aristo is not the Stoic Aristo of Chios (the terminology is
too technical for him and presupposes a theory of predication first attested
for Chrysippus). The evidence is not certain enough for assuming that this

Aristo is the Peripatetic philosopher Aristo of Ceos, either. Perhaps the

Aristo mentioned by Sextus is a third one, maybe a student or colleague of
Critolaus in the Lyceum around 150 B.C. (I am grateful to Stephen A. White
for this suggestion).

747

end consists in "living according to virtue" or in "living consistently."78
In both cases the end in the strict sense turns out to be a predicate, an
incorporeal, not the thing itself but the agent's attaining the thing. The

goal can be set up before the agent, but in practice he can fail to
achieve it; so the agent is not happy unless he or really attains the end.
The goal's being set up before one does not suffice for being happy.
This is a good case against the purely nominalist interpretation which
holds that Stoic incorporeals are inferior realities, since in the Stoic

account the last object of desire is a predicate, an incorporeal some
thing, not a corporeal one.
The second point to be discussed here is related to the Stoic dis
tinction between the verbal adjectives -tov and -T80v (such as cxIq8T?v
and alQ8T8ov). It is true that in none of the extant fragments which
have come down to us and are commonly attributed to the first gener

ation of leading Stoics (Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus) does the
contrast between the verbal adjectives -tos and -teos explicitly occur.79

However, such a contrast is frequently presupposed in the Stoic ac
counts of the psychology of action and is closely connected with the
already mentioned distinction between skopos (a body) and telos (an
incorporeal). As a matter of fact, in the Stoic canonical definition of
end attributed to Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus, such a distinction
is explicitly referred to and sometimes it is taken for granted. So I
shall take the mentioned distinction as belonging to the older Stoics.80

104.

78Stobaeus, Excerpts 2. 77, 18-19 (SVF3:16; LS, 63A).
79 See Tsekourakis, Studies in the Terminology of Early Stoic Ethics,

80 Stobaeus, Excerpts, 2.77, 16-27 (SVF3:19; LS, 63A). Certainly the evi
dence is controversial: according to Galen, Chrysippus thinks that terms such

as "to be chosen" (haireteon), "to be done" (poieteon), "to face with confi

dence" (tarreteon), and "good" (agathon) refer to something different (Ga
len, On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato 7.2. p. 436, 30-3, in Galen on
the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato, 3 vols., edited, translated, and com
mentary by Phillip De Lacy [Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1978-84]). Later (7.2, p.
438, 5-6, ed. De Lacy) Galen says that, in accordance with Chrysippus, only

the good itself (to ?yaO?v out?) is to be chosen (aiQ8Tsov), and done

(jtOLT]T8ov), and faced with confidence (OaQQryr?ov). Plutarch, on his part, at
tributes to Chrysippus the thesis that "the good is choiceworthy" (TayaO?v
a?QEx?v), which seems to fit into the doctrine we find in Stobaeus, Excerpts
2.97, 15-98, 6. What is uncontroversial is the fact that for the older Stoics "to
be happy" is a predicate (not a body) since it consists in "living according to
virtue" or "living consistently," which is the same as "living in accordance
with nature" (see the first reference to Stobaeus cited at beginning of this

note).

MARCELO D. BOERI

In what follows some of the most representative passages (included
in Stobaeus' excerpt of Stoic ethics) are fully quoted; then, a brief
commentary is offered to show the body/incorporeal thesis at work.
1. They say that what is worth being chosen (a?QST?v) and what should
be chosen (aigeTeov) are different. What is worth being chosen is every

<good>, while what should be chosen is every beneficial act

( ^?Xr\\ia), which is considered in relation to having the good. This is
why we choose what should be chosen; for instance, "acting prudently",

which is considered in relation to having prudence. But we do not
choose what is worth being chosen, but if in effect <we do it>, we
choose to have it.81

2. Among the correct acts (xaTOQ0o)^aTa), some are included in what
is necessary <to do>; others are not included.82 Among what is neces
sary are the beneficial acts, which are predicates, such as "acting pru

dently and with moderation."83

3. They say that just as what is worth being chosen and what should be
chosen differ, so too what is worth being desired and what should be
desired, what is worth being wished and what should be wished, what is
worth being accepted and what should be accepted differ as well. For
goods are what is worth being chosen, wished, desired <and accepted,
whereas benefits are those things which should be chosen, wished, de
sired> and accepted, since they are predicates, which lie alongside the
goods. For we choose things that should be chosen and wish for things
that should be wished, and desire things that should be desired. Cer
tainly, choices, desires and wishes are included among predicates, such
as are impulses, too. By contrast, we choose, wish and similarly desire
having goods; this is why goods are not only what is worth being chosen

and wished but also are what is worth being desired. For we choose

having prudence and moderation, (tt]v y?g ?Q?vr\Giv a?Qoi3^i80a ?x?LV
xai xr\v oa)(()Qooi)vr]v) but not acting with prudence and moderation
(ov ?l? A?a t? (|)qov8lv xai OQKJ)QOve?v), which are incorporeal, that is to
say predicates.84

These three passages are closely linked from a thematic point of
view. They are also a good example of the three parts of philosophi

cal discourse at work. Although one can assume that the main sub
ject of these texts is ethical (due to the fact that they are within an al

legedly ethical context), there are crucial elements of Stoic physics
and logic, too. In fact, the Stoic thesis that the truly real are bodies

THE STOICS ON BODIES AND INCORPOREALS

and the doctrine of lekta is present here. If one did not take these
points into account, this piece of evidence would be difficult to inter
pret. The evidence is indeed hard and there is no agreement about the
way it should be understood.85 The last lines of the third passage are
really puzzling. It is hard to understand clearly what is the difference

between "having prudence and moderation" and "acting with pru
dence and moderation," since one might think that you cannot act
with prudence and moderation if you are not in possession of pru
dence and moderation. According to the Stoic position, we choose
what should be chosen, "to be happy" (eudaimone?n), a predicate.
The direct object of our choice is the goal which is "proposed" or "set
up before" us, a body. By contrast, the ultimate object of our choice is
"to act with prudence and moderation" (a predicate), namely that for
the sake of which everything is done but which itself is done in view of

nothing. In other words, we actually choose what should be done,
"acting prudently," an incorporeal predicate.
If one concentrates on the distinction between -tos and -teos ad
jectives, it is easy once more to realize that it deals with the ontologi
cal difference between things or bodies and predicates or incorpore

als. The above cited passages show goods and prudence (a virtue) as
suitable examples of something which is worth being chosen (goods
and prudence, as any other virtue, are bodies).86 Virtue is a body inso
far as it is the commanding part of the soul disposed in a certain way

and, as every good, it is worth being chosen, desired, and so on. A
beneficial act, on the other hand, due to its being a predicate and adja
cent to the goods, should be chosen. The notion of (bc|)?Xr||xa involves

some difficulties. In fact, owing to its being adjacent to the goods
(which by definition are bodies) and happening just to virtuous peo
ple, it sometimes suggests that it is a sort of "correct act."87 But in
other cases, like the one we are commenting on, a beneficial act is
characterized as a predicate and, albeit adjacent to the goods, it con
tinues to be incorporeal (at this point we can again clearly see the
lekta, under the form of predicates, at work in the explanation of the

difference between good and beneficial act). While the adjectives
with the suffix -tos, then, are used to indicate the thing as something

desirable, something worth wishing for, and so forth (that is to say, to
indicate the immediate or direct object of desire, wish, choice, and so

on), the adjectives in -teos will make reference to the action itself.
What should be chosen, desired, or wished for are the beneficial acts:
acting prudently, moderately, courageously, and justly. This is so be

cause what should be chosen, wished, desired is what produces ac
tion in the practical context. Predicates, which are incorporeal, in
some cases do not express an actual state of the world88 but in other
cases certainly do express an actual state of the world (for instance,
"to be a prudent person" said of the Stoic wise person). In general,
however, it must be said that predicates are incorporeal because they
are lekta. Once more it is clear enough, it seems to me, that even in
the domain of the Stoic account of action we could constitute neither

our personal world nor the objective world without taking into con
sideration the bodies and the incorporeals working together. The ac
tual world is not real to us unless we evaluate it with incorporeals
and, more accurately, with the sayables. Incorporeals appear again
playing a central role since they are crucial items for assessing the in
formation given by the things affecting our perceptive capacities.
Once we have evaluated this stuff, we have to put it in place and time,
so that it becomes a "real" object.

I am aware that giving definite conclusions on the corporeal/in
corporeal issue in Stoic philosophy is, if not impossible, at least quite

difficult. My conclusions and inferences are at best tentative. The
conjectural character of our assertions on ancient Stoicism is some
times justified due to the state of the extant remains. Indeed, our at

tempt to reach an accurate account of Stoic doctrines is always
thwarted by the scanty and frequently confusing evidence. In spite of
this, it seems to me that it is possible to be sure about the fact that the
issue concerning the existent/nonexistent relationship appears to be
functioning all the time in Stoic philosophy. Thus it is necessary to
88 In this last sentence I am following Pedersen's line of thought ( The

Stoic Theory of Oikeiosis, 31). However, although provocative, his sugges
tion that "phrone?n will be most appositely translated 'becoming (as op
posed to being) phronimos1" seems to me an over-interpretation.

THE STOICS ON BODIES AND INCORPOREALS
read the ovTa-^ ovtcx distinction as a whole in the different parts of
the philosophical discourse (physics, logic, ethics), and not simply as
a point belonging just to physics. In this sense I would venture to say

that, on the Stoic view, we should seriously consider existents and
nonexistents in all the fields of research, and that these must be un
derstood as working together. If my approach is right, it might be eas
ier to understand why the Stoics were so proud of the coherence of

their philosophical system. They are said to maintain that there
should be a close connection among the parts of philosophy, since if
one changed a single letter the whole system would fall down.89
It may be objected that my general proposal regarding bodies and
incorporeals is rather radical since if it is true, the Stoic ontology re

sembles that of Plato. Thus, according to this objection, bodies ap
pear to be not substantial entities?they do not exist by themselves
but they need incorporeals to be what they are. I do not think that this

consequence follows necessarily because the Stoic incorporeals are
within this level of reality?they are immanent in the corporeal world.

Thus there is no room to compare incorporeals to Platonic Forms.
For Plato, Forms are causes of and ultimately responsible for sensible
things. For the Stoics, I contend, there are no real things without in
corporeals nor incorporeals without real things. This is not the case

with sensibles and Plato's Forms.

My primary purpose in this paper was not to reach secure conclu

sions regarding the true sense of the bodies/incorporeals issue in
early Stoicism, but rather to provoke discussion in a field of research
that has been interpreted in a number of different ways since antiquity
(which surely proves how misleading it was for generations of philos
ophers and interpreters). I have tried to answer the basic question of
whether Stoics held incorporeality (?o(b\iaxa-[ir\ ?vxa) and corporeal

ity (o(b[iaxa-ovx?) to be incompatible ontological domains (as both
some ancient and modern authors have maintained). My answer, as is
obvious, is "no" because, as I hope to have shown, for the Stoics real
ity is the result of the combination of bodies and incorporeals. There
is no break between the two levels of reality. I think that the Stoics
would agree that incorporeals without contents are empty, and bodies

without incorporeals are blind. This is the way in which a human

from Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient?ficas y T?cnicas (Argentina)
as a visiting researcher at the Department of Philosophy of Georgetown Uni
versity (1994-95). The final version was done thanks to an appointment to
the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D. C, as a Junior Fellow in the
academic year 1999-2000. I am grateful to the directors, Deborah Boedeker
and Kurt Raaflaub, for their permanent support and encouragement. I am es
pecially indebted to Richard Bett, whose detailed and acute remarks helped
me to avoid a mistake. I would also like to thank Maximilian Forschner and
Ricardo Salles for their criticism and concern. I read an abridged version of
this paper at Departamento de Filosof?a, Universidade de Brasilia, Brazil, in
December 1996. I benefited from comments of the audience in Brazil and es
pecially from an observation by Jos? Gabriel Trindade Santos. Responsibil
ity for errors remains my own.
